# Force Files

More than dotfiles! It's my Force Files! xD


## About

I was a little tired of having to type long commands in bash and having to organize an initial structure for my projects everytime. Everything was strewn, a real waste of time! That's why, I decided to build this repository.

I realized I could split my dotfiles, automation files, bash aliases, editor settings and a lot of things up into the main areas I use in my Workflow.

**But why a repository?** It's quite simple! Even if someday or somewhere I need it... will be there. So I can check, pick something or download this guy for my recently formated system.

> Notice: I am running on Mac OS X. These are my config files to set up a system the way I use it in my workflow.

$ bash -c "$(curl -fsSL raw.github.com/vitorbritto/forcefiles/master/bin/forcefiles)"
