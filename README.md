# Force Files

More than dotfiles! It's my Force Files! xD


## About

I was a little tired of typing so many lengthy commands in bash and organize an initial structure for my projects everytime I was logged in at Shell. Everything was a mess, a real waste of time! Thus I decided to build this repository.

I realized I could split my dotfiles, automation tasks, bash aliases and functions, editor settings and a lot of things up into the main areas I used to work in my Workflow.

Now, I can check, pick up something or run this guy for my recently fresh system. :ghost:

> Notice: I am running on Mac OSX Yosemite. These are my config files to set up a system the way I use it in my workflow.
